Task #2

Please create a command line tool that queries GitHub workflow runs for a given repository regularly and reports all updates into stdout, one line per event. It should report new workflows being queued, jobs being started and finished, steps within jobs being started and succeeded/failed, with timestamps of the start and completion of each job and step, branch names and commit SHAs.

Please come up with a comprehensible and concise  format for this information.

The user should be able to interrupt the monitoring and terminate the tool gracefully.

When started for a certain repository for the first time, the tool should only report new events. However, when it is started for the same repository again, it should retrieve all workflow run/job/step completion events since the last run of the tool for this repository.

The input for the tool should be a repository and a GitHub personal access token to be used for information retrieval.

Please implement the tool in Java or Kotlin and push it to a public repository in GitHub.

Project Description

"Our tool is a continuous monitoring system that watches GitHub workflows. It checks the GitHub API every 30 seconds to see if any workflows, jobs, or steps have changed state (started, completed, failed, etc.).

On the first run, it only reports events that happen AFTER you start watching.

On subsequent runs, it catches you up on everything that happened since you last ran the tool, then continues monitoring.

It prints one line per event to the console. If nothing changed during a 30-second interval, it stays quiet and checks again after 30 seconds.

The state (last check time and seen events) is saved in a .sentinel-state.json file so it remembers between runs."

//-----------------------------
Think of these as forms that hold information:

WorkflowRun: A form about a workflow

What: "Build and Test Pipeline"
Status: "running" or "completed"
Branch: "main"
Commit: "abc123"
When started: "2025-11-15 10:30:00"
Job: A form about a job inside a workflow

What: "build-linux"
Status: "in_progress"
When started: "2025-11-15 10:30:15"
Step: A form about a step inside a job

What: "Run tests"
Status: "completed"
Result: "success"
Duration: "2 minutes"
MonitoringEvent: What we print to the screen

Type: "JOB_STARTED"
All the details formatted nicely
